# Exploratory-Analysis-of-Global-Earthquake-Tsunami-Events-2001-2022
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of global earthquake and tsunami events (2001–2022) using Python — uncovering trends, patterns, and seismic indicators related to tsunami generation.
📄 Short Summary Report (2001–2022)
🔹 Key Findings from the Analysis

Global earthquake activity between 2001–2022 shows fluctuating frequency but stable overall seismic energy.

Tsunami-generating earthquakes are rare but extremely powerful, mostly with magnitude ≥ 7.5 and depth ≤ 50 km.

Major global events (2004 Sumatra, 2011 Japan, 2015 Chile) caused the largest tsunamis, occurring in subduction zones near coastal regions.

The Pacific Ring of Fire remains the most active seismic and tsunami-prone region worldwide.

🌊 Visual Summary of Tsunami Risk Factors:
Risk Factor	High-Risk Range	Tsunami Likelihood
Magnitude	≥ 7.5	⚡ Very High
Depth (km)	≤ 50	🌍 Very High
Location	Coastal / Subduction Zone	🧭 High
Fault Type	Thrust / Reverse	🌋 High
Inland / Deep Quakes	> 100 km depth	🔹 Low

📈 Interpretation:

Tsunami potential rises sharply when high-magnitude, shallow earthquakes occur beneath or near the ocean floor along subduction plate boundaries.

📊 Interpretation of Earthquake Patterns

Frequency: Earthquake counts vary annually; major spikes align with global seismic disasters (2004, 2011, 2015).

Magnitude Distribution: Most earthquakes are moderate (4.0–6.0), with only a few extreme events (>8.0).

Depth Distribution: Predominantly shallow (≤100 km), but tsunami-generating events cluster below 50 km.

Magnitude–Depth Relationship: A weak negative correlation — stronger quakes occur closer to the surface.

Tsunami Events: Account for less than 5% of total quakes but cause disproportionate damage due to coastal impact.

✅ Overall Conclusion:

Between 2001–2022, global earthquake patterns remained relatively constant in frequency and energy, but shallow, high-magnitude subduction earthquakes emerged as the primary cause of tsunamis.

These findings reinforce the importance of depth and magnitude thresholds as early warning indicators for tsunami-prone regions, especially around the Pacific Ring of Fire.
